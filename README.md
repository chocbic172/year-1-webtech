## Example Credentials
To test the website, the following example credentials can be used:\
**Username:** `testuser`\
**Password:** `S3curePa$$w0rd`

## Design Descisions
- During registration, we do not ask for a users address. This is to simplify the process and
  encourage more users to sign up. A users address can instead be saved in the checkout stage.
- Client side (in browser) form validation has been turned off to demonstrate website
  capabilities. In a real deployment it would be beneficial to enable this.

## Wider Reading
W3, MDN, PHP Docs

## Acessibility and Usability
All text elements were sufficiently visible against their backgrounds.\
Aria-labels have been used.
