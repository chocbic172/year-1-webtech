# UCLAN Shop Webapp

## Home (index.html)

The home page is the landing page of the website. When a user types in the web address or finds the website on a search engine, this is the page they will enter to. It is designed to funnel customers towards the product pages where they can browse and purchase products, as well as providing information about the UCLan Student Union Shop. This page contains both the videos.

## Products (products.html)

This page is the catalog for the products sold on the website. It gives users the ability to browse and find products that interest them. It contains a quick navigation section at the top to provide quick access to all the different types of product (hoodies, jumpers and tshirts).

## Item (item.html)

This page provides further details on each item sold by the shop, including the description, the price and the title. This page also contains a button that allows the user to add the item to their basket (cart) to purchase.

## Cart (cart.html)

The cart contains all the items that have been "added to basket" by the user. It calculates and displays the total cost of all the items in the basket, and provides an option to remove any items that are unwanted.

## Wider Reading
The [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) was heavily used in the development of this project. Where I have used this resource, I have included a comment in the code with an explaination and a link to how it was used.

I also relied on [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) for some other aspects of the project, especially when it comes to using several attributes to perform a task. These instances are also linked in the code documentation.

## Changelog
The changelog of the project has been provided in the file `changelog.txt`.
